 *  This game is an object that dodge from infinite instantiaing enemies capsule. The player has 10 hp and when it bump to an enemey capsule, the player  will loose 1 hp. However, if the player stay for 5 seconds without any damage, the playet will gain 3 points everytime. The score is the points that you gain from the course of your surviving. 
 *  This game is created with unity and C# mainly. Nothing is fancy and rather there are some bugs, but this is my first game I ever made. This took about 2 weeks to finish (with good mentor).
